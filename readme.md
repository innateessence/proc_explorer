## Why does this exist

* the `textual` lib/framework looks super cool to me and I wanted to start building something with it
* I <3 Terminal stuff
* htop is great, but I've always wished the UI was a bit different. I may end up making this an alternative to htop in the way I imagine the ideal `htop` UI to look/feel. Time will tell.
